# Dependencies

## Python itself
https://www.python.org/downloads/

I personally used python 3.8 for this

## imports to install
"pip install PySide2 pyqtgraph"

# Launching the Application

once Python 3.8 is added to your path launch using the command "python ./gui.py" in a terminal

alternativly you can double click on gui.py
